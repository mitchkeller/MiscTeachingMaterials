@book{Bjorner2005,
abstract = {This book is a carefully written exposition of Coxeter groups, an area of mathematics which appears in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics. In this book, the combinatorics of Coxeter groups has mainly to do with reduced expressions, partial order of group elements, enumeration, associated graphs and combinatorial cell complexes, and connections with combinatorial representation theory. While Coxeter groups have already been exposited from algebraic and geometric perspectives, this book will be presenting the combinatorial aspects of Coxeter groups. The authors have included an exposition of Coxeter groups along with a rich variety of exercises, ranging from easy to very difficult, giving the book the unique character of serving as both a textbook and a monograph.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an infinite dimensional associative diagram algebra that satisfies the relations of the generalized Temperley--Lieb algebra having a basis indexed by the fully commutative elements (in the sense of Stembridge) of the Coxeter group of type affine $C$. Moreover, we provide an explicit description of a basis for the diagram algebra. In the sequel to this paper, we show that this diagrammatic representation is faithful. The results of this paper and its sequel will be used to construct a Jones-type trace on the Hecke algebra of type affine $C$, allowing us to non-recursively compute leading coefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.},

@article{Billey2006,
abstract = {The Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for finite Weyl groups arise in the geometry of Schubert varieties and representation theory. It was proved very soon after their introduction that they have nonnegative integer coefficients, but no completely combinatorial interpretation for them is known in general. Deodhar (1990) has given a framework for computing the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which generally involves recursion. We define embedded factor pattern avoidance for general Coxeter groups and use it to characterize when Deodhar's algorithm yields a simple combinatorial formula for the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of finite Weyl groups. Equivalently, if (W, S) is a Coxeter system for a finite Weyl group, we classify the elements w in W for which the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element C'w can be written as a monomial of C's where s in S. This work generalizes results of Billey-Warrington (2001) which identified the Deodhar elements in type A as 321-hexagon-avoiding permutations, and Fan-Green (1997) which identified the fully-tight Coxeter groups.},

@article{Kota2005,
abstract = {This paper introduces the benefits of exploiting elasticity in the engineering design of surgical tools, in general, and of minimally invasive procedures, in particular. Compliant mechanisms are jointless mechanisms that rely on elastic deformation to transmit forces and motion. The lack of traditional joints in these single-piece flexible structures offers many benefits, including the absence of wear debris, pinch points, crevices, and lubrication. Such systems are particularly amenable to embedded sensing for haptic feedback and embedded actuation with active-material actuators. The paper provides an overview of design synthesis methods developed at the Compliant Systems Design Laboratory and focuses specifically on surgical applications. Compliant systems have potential to integrate. well within the constraints of laparoscopic procedures and telerobotic surgery. A load-path representation is used within a genetic algorithm to solve two gripper example problems. In addition, the paper illustrates the design and construction of an organ (kidney) manipulator for use in minimally invasive procedures.},
